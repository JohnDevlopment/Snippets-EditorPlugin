[b]Snippet Fields[/b]
If certain strings of characters called fields are placed in a snippet, then you can provide dynamic values
to subsitute them with. In such cases, clicking on the [img]res://addons/snippets_plugin/icon_action_copy.svg[/img] will popup a window to provide
values to all fields. When you click [code]Finish[/code], the snippet is copied to the clipboard with all of its fields subsitituted with their corresponding values.

To define a field, you put the name of the field (no spaces) before a colon, followed by the prompt, surrounded by percent signs:
[code]
# Example field: %PROPERTY:Prompt%
# Reference the field of the same name: %PROPERTY%
[/code]

The two-argument form defines the field, and the one-argument form references the field of the same name.
